# amls2_assessment
These ipynb notebooks each represent a subtask from task 4 in SemEval2017.

- task_a.ipynb is for subtask 4A
- task_b.ipynb is for subtask 4B
- The Datasets directory contains the Kaggle input files, but not the GloVe embedding file as it is too large for Github. After downloading the files, the   evaluator will have to supply their own file of Glove 300d embeddings to test the code.
